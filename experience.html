                                    <h2>Research Lab Assistant, A.I Calendar</h2>

								
									<p> In this research lab, we created and tested a calendar that would first record particpants talking about what they did throughout their day and secondly
                                        utitlize artificial intelligence to analyze and annotate the transcript and apply it onto a calendar, allowing users to see how they've been spending
                                        time in their days. Annotations included location, type of activity, and other people present, and we were able to set up data visualizations to
                                        show participants how they spent their time in terms of location, category, people, etc....

                                        Within this lab, I used Qualtrics to create several surveys, particpated in interviews, and created a master CSV file that documented all the transcripts, several annotation categories,
                                        and mistakes that the A.I created. From there, I was able to use python to generate hard statistics and data visualizations for the thesis for the final thesis.</p>

                                    <p> Utilizing the Altair library, my team and I came up with several visualizations that all tell a strong narrative revolving around greenhouse gas emissions. 
                                        We heavily prototyped and wireframed each visualization, and created a few that were purposefully deceptive in their nature. Our process can be seeing

                                    employees, we wanted to better understand how each internal stakeholders plays a role within their company, and came up with several ideas on how to better the company.
