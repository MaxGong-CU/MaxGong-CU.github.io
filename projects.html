									<h2>Project 1 Final Statement</h2>

										<p> From my brainstorming for this project, I decided to create a gif showing the artificial intelligence creations of the
										machine and the human hand closing in on each other. It references The Creation of Adam and I wanted to showcase the power 
										of artificial intelligence and its varying uses and styles, so I created a large amount of differing drawings and put them in a 
										looping gif to show how it works. For the charts, I wanted to show how infographics can be misconstrued or can be manipulated 
										by the creators to convey a misleading narrative. The glitch effects help this effect by changing the axis and lines to show 
										what an offset graph may look like. The bottom right gif uses a screenshot that I took from the game Cyberpunk 2077. I thought 
										that the game had a similar aesthetic to the glitch effects that we were working on, and the narrative of Cyberpunk also fits 
										nicely into the idea of glitching and A.I since the character that you play, struggles with an A.I, who used to be a real human,
										start to take over his mind and thus results in glitches. The pancake image was something I did for fun. I made the pancake in
										Illustrator and wanted to glitch it for fun. The other images/videos are things I worked on in class. The horror films used 
										data moshing because I thought it the found footage media mixed with some glitched data would work well in tandem.</p>

											<h2>Project 2 Final Statement</h2>
		
												<p> For this project, I was able to follow up on turning the moth from the video tutorial into a bat. It was really annoying to 
													work with the tutorial. It was a minute long so I thought it would be relativley simple, but really the creator just sped through
													over some of the steps without explaining what was where and how to use it. I mainly struggled with getting the noise modifier to work
													so that the wings would flap correctly. I had to thoroughly scour the internet to figure how to get it to work and eventually I was
													able to get them to flap correctly through sheer luck. I think I was just watching an older version of Blender and I couldn't find 
													any updated resources on the topic of noise modifiers. Another snag I ran into was that the particle system wouldn't allow for
													the bat to be imported into Tik Tok's Effect House. However, I was able to solve this much faster since I could find some code
													to make a frame by frame animation of the particle system. Unfortunatley, when imported into Effect House, the wings wouldn't flap
													I tried decreasing the amount of bats, not having them fly around, and more in order to see if I could get them to flap,
													but nothing worked. I'm still happy with the final product and content that I was able to get the wings to flap in Blender.
													For my second filter, I just made the bat perch on the users shoulder.

											<h2>Project 3 Final Statement</h2>
		
												<p> I had a lot of fun making this project. It was relativley easier for me to come up with an idea for this project since there were more limitations.
													The show being called Lumen Beings instantly made me think of having humans and seeing the examples of the paintings being lit up with the music also
													helped inspire me into doing something similar. I did have a lot of variations for ideas that I wanted to add to this project. At first, I wanted to do
													a white canvas with purple lines for the animation, but when I went to Michael's for the canvas, I saw that these black canvasses existed and I had the idea
													to replicate the album cover of the song that I was going to use, "AM" by Arctic Monkeys. The album cover is just a black background with white soundwave lines,
													so I thought it would fit perfectly. The first thing I did was make the animation for this and then I displayed all 14 frames so that everything was showing
													for the same image. Then I projected it onto my canvasses and painted it with paint markers. There were some details that I added in for the animation, but they
													didn't really show up during the show, which was unfortunate. One of them was that the "clicK" is timed with the snare drum, and I think some people got that but others didn't.
													Another was that when the music swells up, you could see the onion layers on the animation, but that was hard to notice in person.
